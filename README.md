## Binary search

Binary search is a classic algorithm in computer science. It often comes up \
in programming contests and technical interviews. Implementing binary search \
turns out to be a challenging task, even when you understand the concept. \
Unless youâ€™re curious or have a specific assignment, you should always \
leverage existing libraries to do a binary search in Python or any other language.
